# nwos
The nwos package was designed to access and manipulate data as well as generate estimates for the U.S. Forest Service's National Woodland Owner Survey. The functions incorporate the NWOS sample design to generate estimates. Estimates can be generated for totals, proportions, means, medians, and associated variances.

The accompanying vignettes shows the basic steps necessary to access data ("get-NWOS-data") and generate estimates ("calculate-NWOS-estimates") using this package.
