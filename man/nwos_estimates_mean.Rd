\title{NWOS Estimate Mean}
\usage{
nwos_estimates_mean(weight, area = 1, domain = 1, variable)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight}{vector of weights.}

\item{area}{vector of area (e.g., forest acres in the stratum). Default = 1 (i.e., estimates are in terms of ownerships).}

\item{stratum}{vector with 1 indicating inclusion in the stratum and 0 otherwise. Default = 1 (i.e., all ownerships are in the same stratum).}

\item{domain}{binary vector (i.e., dummay variable) with 1 indicating inclusion in the domain  of interest and 0 otherwise. Default = 1 (i.e., all ownerships are included).}

\item{variable}{vector of values for the variable of interest.}
}
\value{
Mean of variable of interest.
}
\description{
Calculate means for the NWOS.
}
\details{
This function needs to be run by stratum (e.g., family forest ownerships in a state).
