\title{NWOS Total}
\usage{
nwos_total(weight, area = 1, stratum = 1, domain = 1, variable = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight}{vector of weights per observation.}

\item{area}{vector of area (e.g., forest acres) per observation. Default = 1 (i.e., estimates are in terms of ownerships).}

\item{stratum}{vector with 1 indicating inclusion in the stratum and 0 otherwise. Default = 1 (i.e., all ownerships are in the same stratum).}

\item{domain}{vector with 1 indicating inclusion in the domain and 0 otherwise. Default = 1 (i.e., all ownerships are included).}

\item{variable}{vector of variable of interest. Default = 1 (i.e., variable is ignored).}
}
\description{
Estimator used to calculate NWOS totals.
}
\details{
If area is set to 1, then the esitmates are in terms of ownerships.
Variable can be binary or continuous. If variable is binary, the value returned is the number of ownerships or acreage in the domain of interest with that attribute. If variable is continuous, the value returned is the variable total in terms of ownerships or acreage.
